At the moment Cirrus CI only supports repositories hosted on GitHub. This guide will walk you through the installation process.
If you are interested in a support for other code hosting platforms please fill up [this form](https://forms.gle/CkcxPnMjA2u5ctQf7)
to help us prioritize the support and notify you once the support is available.

Start by configuring the [Cirrus CI application](https://github.com/marketplace/cirrus-ci) from GitHub Marketplace.

Choose a plan for your personal account or for an organization you have admin writes for.

GitHub Apps can be installed on all repositories or on repository-by-repository basis for granular access control. For
example, Cirrus CI can be installed only on public repositories and will only have access to these public repositories.
In contrast, classic OAuth Apps [don't have such restrictions](https://developer.github.com/apps/differences-between-apps/#what-can-github-apps-and-oauth-apps-access).

!!! note "Change Repository Access"
    You can always revisit Cirrus CI's repository access settings on [your installation page](https://github.com/apps/cirrus-ci/installations/new).

## Post Installation

Once Cirrus CI is installed for a particular repository, a `.cirrus.yml` configuration file should be added to the root of the repository. 
The `.cirrus.yml` defines tasks that will be executed for every build for the repository. 

For a Node.js project, your `.cirrus.yml` could look like:

=== "amd64"

    ```yaml
    container:
      image: node:latest
    
    check_task:
      node_modules_cache:
        folder: node_modules
        fingerprint_script: cat yarn.lock
        populate_script: yarn install
      test_script: yarn test
    ```

=== "arm64"

    ```yaml
    arm_container:
      image: node:latest
    
    check_task:
      node_modules_cache:
        folder: node_modules
        fingerprint_script: cat yarn.lock
        populate_script: yarn install
      test_script: yarn test
    ```

That's all! After pushing a `.cirrus.yml` a build with all the tasks defined in the `.cirrus.yml`
file will be created.

**Note:** Please check the [full guide on configuring Cirrus Tasks](writing-tasks.md) and/or check [a list of available examples](../examples.md).

!!! tip "Zero-config Docker Builds"
    If your repository happened to have a `Dockerfile` in the root, Cirrus CI will attempt to build it even without
    a corresponding `.cirrus.yml` configuration file.

You will see all your Cirrus CI builds on [cirrus-ci.com](https://cirrus-ci.com/) once signed in.

GitHub status checks for each task will appear on GitHub as well.

Newly created PRs will also get Cirrus CI's status checks.

!!! info "Examples"
    Don't forget to check [examples page](../examples.md) for ready-to-copy examples of some `.cirrus.yml` 
    configuration files for different languages and build systems.

!!! info "Life of a build"
    Please check [a high level overview of what's happening under the hood](build-life.md) when a changed is pushed
    and [this guide](writing-tasks.md) to learn more about how to write tasks.

## Authorization on Cirrus CI Web App

All builds created by your account can be viewed on [Cirrus CI Web App](https://cirrus-ci.com/) after signing in with
your GitHub Account:

<img src="/assets/images/screenshots/github/cirrus-web-sign-in.png" />

After clicking on `Sign In` you'll be redirected to GitHub in order to authorize access:

<img src="/assets/images/screenshots/github/github-app-auth.png" />

!!! note "Note about *Act on your behalf*"
    Cirrus CI only asks for several kinds of permissions that you can see on [your installation page](https://github.com/apps/cirrus-ci/installations/new).
    These permissions are read-only except for write access to checks and commit statuses in order for Cirrus CI to
    be able to report task statuses via checks or commit statuses.

    There is a long thread disscussing this weird "*Act on your behalf*" wording [here](https://github.community/t/why-does-this-forum-need-permission-to-act-on-my-behalf/120453/7)
    on GitHub's own commuity forum.

## Enabling New Repositories after Installation

If you choose initially to allow Cirrus CI to access all of your repositories, all you need to do is push a `.cirrus.yml` to start
building your repository on Cirrus CI.

If you only allowed Cirrus CI to access certain repositories, then add your new repository to
the list of repositories Cirrus CI has access to via [this page](https://github.com/apps/cirrus-ci/installations/new),
then push a `.cirrus.yml` to start building on Cirrus CI.
