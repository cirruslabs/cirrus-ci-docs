# GitHub Annotations Support

While working on a new functionality or fixing an issue itâ€™s crucial to get CI feedback as soon as possible. Fast CI builds are important but itâ€™s also important how fast one can find a reason of a failing build. Usual flow requires to open a separate page for the failing CI build and scroll through all the logs to finally find a relevant error message. How inefficient!

Today Cirrus CI starts supporting GitHub Annotations to provide inline feedback right where you review your code. No need to switch context anymore!

This became possible as a result of recently added features like [execution behaviour](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#execution-behavior-of-instructions) and [artifacts](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#artifacts-instruction). Now each artifact can specify a *format* so it can be parsed into annotations. Here is an example of `.cirrus.yml` file which saves and annotates JUnit reports of a Gradle build:

```yaml
container:  
  image: gradle:jdk8 

check_task:  
  script: gradle check  
  always:    
    junit_artifacts:      
      path: "**/test-results/**/*.xml"      
      format: junit
```

Currently Cirrus CI can only parse JUnit XML but many tools use this format already. Please [let us know](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-annotations/issues/new) what kind of formats Cirrus CI should support next! [The annotation parser is also open source](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-annotations) and contributions are highly appreciated! ðŸ˜‰

We highly encourage everyone to try Cirrus CI. Itâ€™s free for public repositories and all organizations get **200 CPU hours worth of [compute credits](https://cirrus-ci.org/pricing/)** to try it on private repositories.

As always donâ€™t hesitate to ping [support](https://cirrus-ci.org/support/) or ask any questions [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cirrus_labs).
